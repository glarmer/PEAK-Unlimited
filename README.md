## Installation
In theory only the host should need to do this, however, I have not had the ability to thoroughly test this so please let me know if you test this with 5+ people successfully.

1.) Download Bepinex from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip) <br>
2.) Extract the contents of that zip into your game directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK) resulting in a folder that has the following files: <br>

3.) Start the game and close it again, this does the first time set up for Bepinex. <br>
4.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the PeakUnlimited.dll from releases into this folder. <br>
5.) Run the game <br>

## Configuration
- Configuration can be found at: (steam directory)\PEAK\BepInEx\config\PeakUnlimited.cfg

## Important
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.

### Notes:
- I've noticed I crash if I run the game on Vulkan, if you experience this try DX12
- I've not been able to properly test this yet, it might flat out not work.
- Please let me know if you have tested this with 5 or more players successfully, it should work in its current state but unfortunately I have not had the ability to test properly yet.
