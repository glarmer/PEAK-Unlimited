# Peak-Unlimited
A mod for PEAK which raises the lobby max player count


This mod should set the max player count to 10. In the future I plan to add a configuration setting to allow you to change this to whatever desired number. 

Set Up: 
1.) Download Bepinex from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip) <br>
2.) Extract the contents of that zip into your game directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK) resulting in a folder that has the following files: <br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/403d9a1d-16a4-409c-a046-bc56141ac0ca) <br>
3.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the PeakUnlimited.dll from releases into this folder. <br>
4.) Run the game <br>

Notes:
- I've noticed I crash if I run the game on Vulkan, if you experience this try DX12
- I've not been able to properly test this yet, it might flat out not work.
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.
