Introducing, "PEAK Unlimited", a mod for PEAK which raises the lobby max player count to any number you want (max 20 to respect the servers), only the host needs to have this mod! 

## Configuration
- Configuration can be found at: (steam directory)\PEAK\BepInEx\config\PeakUnlimited.cfg
- The default max is 20
- Game may become unstable with lots of players

## Installation

The mod is uploaded to Thunderstore, although at present Thunderstore seems to not be able to conduct automatic installs properly for PEAK so your mileage may vary.

## Manual Installation
Only the host needs to install!

1.) Download Bepinex from [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.3/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.3.zip) <br>
2.) Extract the contents of that zip into your game directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PEAK) resulting in a folder that has the following files: <br>

3.) Start the game and close it again, this does the first time set up for Bepinex. <br>
- If you are on linux, set the launch option `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%` before running the game. <br>
4.) Navigate to ...\PEAK\BepInEx\plugins, copy and paste the PeakUnlimited.dll from releases into this folder. <br>
5.) Run the game <br>

## Important
- DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE COMPLAIN ABOUT BUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS WHILE USING MODS. UNINSTALL MODS IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS AND THEN REPORT THEM IF THEY ARE STILL PRESENT.
- If you have issues with auto install, try manually installing with the version of BepInEx that I link above.
- Please report issues to [the mods github](https://github.com/glarmer/PEAK-Unlimited/), alternatively I will periodically check the [steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3501916945&tscn=1750268995)
